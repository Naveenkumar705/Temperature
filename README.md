# TemperatureConverter

# Project Description:
The Temperature Converter project is a simple tool that allows users to convert temperatures between different units: Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. This tool takes user input, processes the temperature value, and converts it to the desired unit. The application provides an interactive experience by enabling users to select the unit they wish to convert from and the unit they wish to convert to. The conversion only occurs when all three fields (temperature, from unit, and to unit) are filled, ensuring accurate results.

# Key Features:
Input Field for Temperature: Users can enter a temperature value to be converted.
Unit Selection:
Users can select the unit they want to convert from (Celsius, Fahrenheit, Kelvin).
Users can select the unit they want to convert to.
Real-time Conversion: The conversion happens dynamically when the user selects a unit and clicks the "Convert" button.
Convert Button Activation: The "Convert" button is enabled only when all three fields (temperature, from unit, and to unit) are filled in.
Output Display: Once the "Convert" button is clicked, the converted temperature is displayed below the form.
Responsive Design: The interface adapts to different screen sizes, making it usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

# Technologies Used:
HTML: To create the structure of the temperature converter form.
CSS: For styling and making the user interface visually appealing.
JavaScript: For handling the user input, performing the calculations, and updating the output dynamically.
